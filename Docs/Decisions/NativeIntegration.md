# Native integration boundaries

**Status:** Accepted constraints of the pinned implementation; unresolved limitations remain.

Keep native ownership and visible limitations explicit when composing or extending Chio.

## Native chrome

Native list focus chrome uses SwiftTUI's theme; Chio themes selected content and
controls. The native theme environment is not public. `StatusBar` composes a text
rule because native Divider ignores ambient foreground. Keep these upstream
limits visible without a second focus system or renderer.

## Remaining boundaries

These limits apply to the pinned implementation; none authorizes another
renderer, focus system or hidden dependency patch.

| Boundary | Current limit and responsible follow-up |
| --- | --- |
| Native style hooks | Table border/background chrome, list focus gutter, palette shell, prompt headers and disabled-editor glyph paint are not fully controlled by Chio. Keep native behavior and resolve missing hooks upstream. |
| Layout and lifecycle | Scroll focus reveal can move a two-axis viewport by one cell; nested tab strips can receive stale width proposals; expanded disclosure focus includes descendants. Keep the documented native contracts for [scrolling](Scrolling.md#scrolling), [tabs](Tabs.md#tabs) and [disclosure](DisclosureGroups.md#expandable-groups-and-trees). |
| Choice composition | Changing choice fields inside `GeometryReader` triggered a native debug lifecycle-publication assertion. The full-window example uses `terminalSize`; arbitrary nesting remains unproved. |
| Collection measurement | Native ideal-size probes can realize all rows before a bounded viewport commits and emit deferred `collection.unboundedRealization` warnings. Small fixtures do not prove virtualization or large-dataset performance; diagnostics are retained. |
| Early input | Search, palette and form handoffs cover documented type-ahead/batched paths. Arbitrary multi-control input before presentation settles needs native support, not an application-built editor or focus graph. |
| Portability and accessibility | CI and pseudo-terminals cover specific workflows. Other distributions, architectures, assistive technologies and live SSH devices require separate evidence. Static Linux remains [blocked](Dependencies.md#static-linux-blocker). |
